# Module 2 challenge

This is my portfolio site, the take home assignment in module 2.

The features of this site include:

- The HTML and CSS were written from scratch
- Created navigation bar with clickable links
- Added links to personal sites and means of contact
- Added sections as semantic markup to separate the parts of the site
- Used flex-box elements in navigation bar and to solve other layout needs
- Media queries were used to control break points to support different devices and screen sizes
- CSS variables were used to make colors consistent on the page
