      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Queen John. Before starting software development, 
        I have worked with Nestle Nigeria PLC as
        a Sales Analyst. I got interested in software development to 
        kickstart a new path in my career. Currently based in Canada, but i am interested 
        in work opportunities anywhere 
        in the world. I honour my culture which is the origin of some of the world's greatest food
        and music. Love Afrobeats!
